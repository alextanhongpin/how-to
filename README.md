The how-to


## How to learn?

- just reading - doesn't help much, my comprehension is still poor
- watching video - seems like a good option if it's not touching code, mainly for exploration

some tactics to try

Summarizer:
- look through the chapter
- see the sections
- for each section, find the 3 main points
- write a summary for each section

Asker:
- read the chapter
- ask questions that you are interested in
- find answers from the chapter, or externally
